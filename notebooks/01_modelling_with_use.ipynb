    "\n",
    "So how does USE work? According to its website, \"the Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high-dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other natural language tasks.\" Furthermore, it has been \"trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs\". This is good for our purposes, since we're interested in clustering our corpora of reviews at the sentence level. Here is an example of how USE works:"

    "These are pretty good results! Our sample sentence expressed the idea that the story was good, even though it was predictable, and we find this same idea in several of the sentences identified as most semantically similar. Not all of the identified sentences expressed this idea, however: some found the story unpredictable, noting the plot's twists and turns, and others did not find the story all that good. But on the whole, these are impressive results. The USE embeddings do seem to do a pretty good job of identifying semantically similar sentences.\n",

    "Recall that USE embeddings are encoded in such a way that semantically similar sentences are placed in the same region in the 512-dimensional vector space. Because of this, **semantically similar sentences will form clusters in the vector space. The most populated clusters will represent those semantic regions with the greatest number of sentences in them.** Thus, if we wish to find the most commonly expressed opinions in our dataset, we just need to a way to identify these most populated clusters.\n",

    "Though not a perfect method, k-means clustering provides the easiest and quickest way to identify these clusters. It will divide our complete set of sentence vectors into k number of clusters based on their spatial distribution, such that close groups of points are clustered together. We can then find the centre of each these clusters, and identify the sentences closest to these cluster centres. These sentences will then represent the k most commonly expressed opinions in our dataset. Let's now see this in action."

      "I would have given this book 5 stars as I literally couldn't stop reading it, but I HATED the ending!\n",
      "The ending was also a tad confusing (mostly just the last pages).\n",
      "The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star book is the ending - not what I expected and, for me, morally unsatisfying.\n",
      "However, I really disliked the ending.\n",

      "I gave it four stars since the ending wasn't entirely satisfying.\n",
      "It was a great book but the beginning was hard to follow and the ending was confusing, take it how you want to I guess?\n",
      "Although I was initially put off by the ending, I now think that it makes good sense.\n",
      "It's a disturbing read and I'm still not sure about the ending, but I'm still thinking about, which I guess from the authors point of view is a good thing.\n",
      "Disappointing ending ruined it for me.\n",
      "I was so stunned by the sudden turn of the story, and I was so disappointed and angry about the ending, 'what?'\n",

      "I'm not sure about the ending, but I can't really think of another way it could have ended and still be satisfying.\n",
      "I did enjoy the readability factor, I wanted to see how it would wrap up (though the actual ending made me want to kill things), so I read it quickly.\n",
      "The only downside is that I would have liked a little more explanation to the ending.\n",
      "Having said that, I thought the book was well written, with some beautiful turns a phrase, and I did want to see what happened in the end, which brings to another point - the end.\n",
      "The ending didn't ring true to me and seemed a bit over the top.\n",
      "It's a true thriller, of the can't-put-down variety, but the Book Two twist and the ending both turned me off completely.\n",
      "The ending especially was really unsettling and left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but I can't say that it didn't absolutely fit for the story.\n",
      "My only gripe: I'm not totally in love with the ending.\n",
      "Wasn't the biggest fan of the ending but the storyline was great!\n",

      "Kind of disappointed in the ending.\n",

      "This book started slow and a bit boring, but once the plot twist hit, I couldn't put it down!\n",
      "(The kind of throw that made me question myself if I should pick it up again, well that until I reached the second part, which made me can't even put it down)   Intensely twisted plot, and fucked up characters.\n",
      "The only thing I'm not so sure about is the ending.\n",
      "But that doesn't mean the ending dragged, it just wasn't as strong as the rest of the book.\n",
      "I had a great time reading this (it's SUCH a page-turner) up until the end, which I utterly hated.\n",
      "It goes downhill as it unfolds and the ending was subpar.\n",
      "The ending was hateful, on so many levels, and I will not spoil it here.\n",
      "However, having been pulled so deeply into the characters' stories, I was disappointed at what did not feel like a satisfying ending for them.\n",
      "Over all I wasn't satisfied with the ending - I wanted revenge.\n",
      "I think the character development isn't very well thought-out and I got about halfway through the book and it had gone NOWHERE.\n",
      "At the same time, I was not thrilled with the ending.\n",
      "The ending felt a little abrupt.\n",
      "The ending of this book actually made me crazy!\n",
      "I literally guessed every single character had done it before the plot twist was revealed, and that ending was plain not expected.\n",
      "Then it began to get better as the mystery deepened, but the ending felt very unsatisfying.\n",
      "What I liked: I liked how fast-paced it was, and how many unexpected twists there were in the book.\n",
      "But the ending was just blah\n",
      "And because I disliked them so much I was also disappointed at the ending.\n",
      "The plot twists were clever, and the narrative was engaging, but ultimately the book was so dark and its characters so unappealing that I couldn't come around to enjoying it as much as others did.\n",
      "I liked the beginning-- very intriguing and it sucked me right in.\n",
      "I still recommend Gone Girl as I do feel the middle of the book (right up until the end) was worth it just for the \"this is craaazy!\"\n",
      "Not my usual read and by the end was ready for it to be finished.\n",
      "I swear if it isn't for the least-expected ending, I would've give it a straight 5stars.\n",
      "I wanted a closure, a real ending, a guilty one, but in reality, this book feels like it is never going to end.\n",
      "My only negative point is the ending.\n",
      "even an ending that in any other book would have disappointed me.\n",
      "I truly enjoyed it, I couldn't wait to come home and continue with the twist of the story.\n",
      "I won't spoil anything, but Flynn lost me at the denoument and I ultimately found the ending both unbelievable and disappointing.\n",
      "Now that I finished I gave it 3 stars cause, although I literally hated the ending, it is a catching and addicting book, and I loved all but the last two chapters when I felt totally disappointed.\n",
      "It's a good book, the twist at the end is really really, well I didn't see it coming until I did.\n",
      "I think I would have ranked it higher if I had liked the ending.\n",
      "I finished it and can say I was captivated basically the whole way through but I was also so glad it was over.\n",
      "I hope that the ending was different because I am such a sucker for endings where the bad girl gets what she deserve.\n",
      "The second part was much more fast-paced and exciting and I seriously didn't expect that twist!\n",
      "The ending was not satisfying though.\n",
      "unsatisfied by the end of it (and yes I know I didn't actually finish it), but even throughout the listening process, I was unsatisfied, until the very last section I wasn't pulled in and I didn't look forward to going back to read it.\n",
      "i would have preferred an ending with less loose ends.\n",
      "Many readers didn't care for the ending but I wouldn't change a word!\n",
      "I didn't have high expectations because just about every review out there shows some anger at the ending.\n",
      "And while at first I really hated this, in the end I realized it kept me hooked and I enjoyed finding out the truth.\n",
      "I usually don't read this type of book, but it was enjoyable with some unexpected twists.\n",
      "I'm just not happy with the ending and I don't want to be a spoiler so that is all I can say.\n",
      "I highly recommend the book as a great read, but I'd love to hear if others feel the same as I do about the ending.\n",
      "Not crazy about the ending, but not so much that I can reverse my opinion that this book is engrossing!\n",
      "A little let down by the ending but in other ways not.\n",
      "This book was well written by a talented author, but I still found the ending a disappointment.\n",
      "I am glad I read it, I just disagreed with some of the more outlandish twists!\n",
      "i really hated the first part seemed so bland then bam your into part two and wow does the story gets pace, the end had me riveted but i just was not happy with it - that i guess is the point!!\n",
      "For me this ending wasn't even satisfying.\n",
      "But other than that I thought this was a very engaging story with a great twist that turned it into something unexpected.\n",
      "What dropped the rating was that I didn't like the ending.\n",
      "I was completely hooked and couldn't stop thinking about the plot when I had to put it down.\n",
      "I was very tempted to skip to the end so I just figure out what happened and end it there.\n",
      "The ending left me hanging and feeling a little unsatisfied.\n",
      "That is, until the ending which just didn't ring true for such a well-written novel.\n",
      "Exciting story, character driven, kept me guessing and interested all the way, but I found the ending not believable at all!\n",
      "The twists were great, it was well-written and plotted and paced, but I was infuriated at the end.\n",
      "For that reason alone, I disliked the ending.\n",
      "I muddled along to the end but I found the writing disjointed and not very compelling.\n",
      "Not sure I am crazy with the ending but not sure it could have been done much different despite my wanting it to end differently!\n",
      "The ending has left me with many questions.\n",
      "The ending is somewhat abrupt like there should have been more closure for Nick but I guess that is the point.\n",
      "I really enjoyed it, even though I hate both of the main characters.\n",
      "Many things were too sensational, and the ending was extremely unsatisfying.\n",
      "And then the ending actually came and I was a bit pissed off (excuse the language).\n",
      "I wish the ending had more justice.\n",
      "I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for the ending.\n",
      "Knowing the ending did not make me want to read through the pain like it usually does.\n",
      "But it was still a great beach book, with some nice plot twists and an oddly satisfying ending.\n",
      "Still, I loved much of the second half of the book and eventually couldn't put it down.\n",
      "So, while a well written book, in the end it just wasn't a book I liked.\n",
      "In summary - a great read, I was a little disappointed by the ending, but if her writing is as good in her other two books, I am in for a treat.\n",
      "I wish there was more of a revengeful ending.\n",
      "I wasn't fond of the back and forth POV, the myriad of details left me skimming pages, and I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but I wanted to throw my kindle across the room.\n",
      "To say that I found the ending deeply troubling would be an understatement, and anyone who has read this book will know what I mean.\n",
      "I absolutely HATED the way this book ended.\n",
      "I thought this book was well written and it really keeps you guessing as to how it would end.\n",
      "I really hated the ending but I understand why Flynn chose to end it that way.\n",
      "Love this book but the ending is going to piss you off!!!!\n",
      "Really didn't like how it ended!\n",
      "It definitely kept me drawn in, and I NEEDED to know how it ended, but I just feel like it's not finished.\n",
      "Loved the first half but it really started to drag in the second half and by the end I found it a bit laughable.\n",
      "Although the second half of the book is very suspenseful and will keep you reading through to the end, it left me feeling sad and disturbed because I'm wondering if I'm going to now question how well I know the people I love.\n",
      "The ending is unbearably disappointing, I'm sorry to have to say.\n",
      "I loved it and then it just ended.\n",
      "The ending was just as screwed up as the story and consequently, utterly perfect.\n",
      "I would have given this book the complete 5 stars except I did not like the ending.\n",
      "[I hesistate to give this book the full five stars because I'm not sure how I feel about the ending.\n",
      "However, I was disappointed in the ending - although it did leave the possibility for a sequel.\n",
      "However, the ending was a bit weak and disappointing.\n",
      "I am definitely among the readers who were annoyed by the ending.\n",
      "This book had it all for me, including one of the best endings I have read in awhile.\n",
      "However, the ending made me pretty angry.\n",
      "The only thing that I was disappointed about was the end, it was kind of a cliff hanger.\n",
      "However, I was underwhelmed by the ending.\n",
      "The lackluster conclusion was the final nail in the coffin for me, though: it just felt carelessly tossed together and ridiculous.\n",
      "I really liked this book until the end.\n",
      "I thought at various times that I had \"figured out\" the ending.\n",
      "I was disgusted by the ending, and by the characters overall.\n",
      "I've never been so oddly happy and unhappy with an ending before.\n",
      "The plot went back and forth between intriguing and boring, so it was enough to keep me reading, but I didn't particularly enjoy it.\n",
      "My only minor complaint was the ending.\n",
      "The book left me very unsettled, as I just didn't *like* the characters.\n",
      "It had unexpected twists in the story line, and kept you guessing the whole way through.\n",
      "And finally there was a horrible ending that felt like the author was rushed to end the book.\n",
      "Rather, It just disappoints me that a story so smart ends without closure.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this book, until the end.\n",
      "The ending felt anti-climactic, like she wasn't sure where to end it and therefore just kind of piddled it away until she just picked a random stopping point.\n",
      "It's really a well-written narrative with a superbly crafted plot - I am sad that I am finished reading it!\n",
      "The rest of the novel was precise and tense and obviously very well thought out, but the ending felt rushed and unfinished.\n",
      "After that change and the revelation, though, the plot twists weren't as exciting as I'd hoped and I just couldn't get into it, as much as I wanted to.\n",
      "Some people complain about the ending but it's the opposite of cliche so it worked for me.\n",
      "I loved the suspense which kept me on edge until the very last page!\n",
      "Four stars because I didn't enjoy the ending.\n",
      "That said after one gets about two-thirds of the way through the book the story became a little too fantastic, too far-fetched for me to thoroughly enjoy.\n",
      "I thought it started off kind of slow and I wasn't sure it would really pick up, but halfway through I couldn't put the book down!\n",
      "I finished it yesterday and I can't even remember how it ended.\n",
      "Once it picked up, it got really good, but then I felt like the author was also rushing to the end.\n",
      "It really had a HUGE twist that caught me off guard.\n",
      "I enjoyed the rest of the book, and found it to be a page-turner.\n",
      "I couldn't stop reading until I found out how the story would end.\n",
      "I did find the book to be predicable at times, but overall I really liked it.\n",
      "The thing that totally spoilt this book for me was the ending which is why I have not given it 5 stars.\n",
      "It felt like she had no idea how to end it and if that was her choice, there should have been 200 more pages tacked onto the ending.\n",
      "In fact I liked this book up until the end.\n",
      "I really didn't like this book, though, no matter how well-written it was.\n",
      "Don't want to say too much to give away the game but the twist in the tale really threw me and I enjoyed the darker sides of the characters much much more.\n",
      "So though I'm still emotionally unsatisfied by the ending, I do sincerely appreciate what she was doing.\n",
      "You never knew what would happen next and the ending was bittersweet.\n",
      "It left me thinking, from beginning to end, that the characters got what they deserved.\n",
      "The only criticism I have is the ending.\n",
      "I was also not prepared for the ending.\n",
      "I was definitely shocked over and over while reading, right up to the end.\n",
      "The beginning of the story was a bit slow, but as soon as I hit part two, I couldn't put it down.\n",
      "I felt bad for the husband at the end of the book, but I found the ending to be true to the characters that had been presented.\n",
      "I think for the clever and intrguing parts and the way these are written it deserves praise but the rest of it and the ending brought it down in my opinion.\n",
      "It took a long time for the story to get going in the end it was quite disappointing.\n",
      "And the hype was so ridiculous that the ending had been spoiled for me before I got the book.\n",
      "The story grabbed me, it was fast paced and had an ending that made my skin crawl.\n",
      "Ok, totally did not see that ending coming.\n",
      "Could not put it down but I was left feeling dissatisfied with the anticlimactic ending.\n",
      "Even though it was unsatisfying, I liked it because I in no way predicted it at all.\n",
      "Good story, but the end is so frustrating that I couldn't rate it better.\n",
      "I think the writing was very good, but by the end I felt the characters were so unlikeable it forced me to remove a star.\n",
      "I liked the ending because by the end of the book you don't really feel bad for either Nick or Amy so it was a fitting and unexpected end for the two crazies.\n",
      "The other problem I had was the ending.\n",
      "The book was great (revenge plot unfold with the twist and turns), but the ending is terrible.\n",
      "And this is what annoyed me about the ending -- not that it ended the way it did (I had no problems with that -- in fact, I thought it was the best of three logical outcomes) but that it was jammed in.\n",
      "By the end I really did not like either of the main characters.\n",
      "I'm not at all sure if I liked the ended.\n",
      "I just feel that I came out of this experience with an abundance of questions and not enough answers, and an ending that's a cliffhanger at best.\n",
      "The ending is brilliant especially the final few sentences .\n",
      "The end completely surprised me; in fact the entire book really blew my mind.\n",
      "I think I would have given it four, maybe even five stars if it weren't for the ending.\n",
      "The plot has so many twists and turns in it that I felt it was a little hard to keep up and defantly hard to figure out the ending, which I do in a murder mystery novel.\n",
      "I know there were a lot of complaints about the end but I think it was true to the story.\n",
      "The book was very well done, but in the end, it felt .\n",
      "The ending wow you just hope people aren't really like that!\n",
      "What I liked:   * Reading from both characters perspective   * Mystery and Intrigue   What I didn't like:   ***Spoiler ***   The ending, I really really wanted some vengeance!\n",
      "I was debating whether or not to give it four stars because of the ending, but even I have to admit that the entire plot line was SO twisted, SO unique, and SO imaginative, that it deserved the fifth star.\n",
      "The only reason I'm not giving Gone Girl 5 stars is because I felt that the ending wasn't satisfying and it just.\n",
      "I hated it, and yet I couldn't stop reading it.\n",
      "I almost didn't hate this book as much as I was determined to by the end.\n",
      "I liked the second half a lot less, but it was still enjoyable.\n",
      "I read the last page, turned it expecting more and was left with a \"hmm\" However the rest of the book was very well written and definitely kept me on my toes.\n",
      "I understand now when everyone said it REALLY gets interesting about half way through, but I just didn't see that twist coming.\n",
      "I have to say that while I'm not so sure about the ending, the entire book had me wanting to know if Amy gets away with it, and how the story will unfold.\n",
      "I was glad that everything felt resolved in the end but it didn't redeem the book for me.\n",
      "The beginning was great, but it started to fall apart a bit at the end for me.\n",
      "I have to say it was actually quit disappointing by the end.\n",
      "I thought I was going to like this when I started reading it but the further into it I got the less I liked it.\n",
      "It took me a long time to finish this book, but it wasn't because I didn't like it.\n",
      "I am glad I stuck with it, lots of twists and turns I didn't see coming.\n",
      "I flip-flopped a million times over which characters I liked and who I was rooting for, the ending surprised me and I have to say, didn't give me a whole lot of closure.\n",
      "I enjoyed this book it had a lot of unique twists and turns to it and the end was surprising, but I feel that it did not stand up to all the hype I had heard about it.\n",
      "Well this book ended off with one of the most interesting and unexpected endings.\n",
      "however I wasn't pleased with the ending.\n",
      "Its good, the twists were very surprising, but I didn't like the characters enough to care \"whodunit. \"\n",
      "the way the story was told was great but I couldnt stand the character Amy and the ending made me want to throw the book across the room\n",
      "I liked the twists and I liked the helplessness that I felt as the story unfolded.\n",
      "I would have given it five stars, but I found the ending anti-climatic or worst yet, the character I was rooting for turns out to be not so likeable.\n",
      "The first half of the book was so boring to me and I felt like it just dragged on.\n",
      "Plot twist galore meant I had no idea what the hell was going on for a good part of this book and that was so refreshing to me!\n",
      "I hope they change the ending for the movie!\n",
      "Again, maybe I'm being picky, but those things kept it from being a complete 5 star rating to me, but I did like the ending, and I like that the \"bad guy\" wins .\n",
      "In a way though, the ending was refreshing.\n",
      "The ending was anti-climatic and seemed rushed.\n",
      "Like many reviewers before me I have struggled through the first half of the book, but then it gets really interesting and it held my interest through to the end.\n",
      "The only downside was the ending.\n",
      "About half way through this book I wasn't sure how I felt about it because I didn't like either of the main characters.\n",
      "Yes this book was gripping and the plot was clever, I kept reading right until the end - but it was more out of frustration.\n",
      "Early comments from bookclubers have everyone liking the book but almost hating the ending.\n",
      "The suspense of this book was really good but the plot made me so mad!!\n",
      "I thought it was captivating and as the story unfolded I too quickly caught on to the whole scheme/scam and soon enough I knew how the story was going to unfold and conclude - but that's Ok. .\n",
      "Compelling, lots of twists and turns, but a rubbish ending!\n",
      "I wish I could have given it more stars but in the end, I really did think it was just \"ok. \" It started out slow but I stuck with it.\n",
      "I was hoping for a better ending (a more happier one) but knowing what you know about the characters and how they are, it's kind of expected in a different way.\n",
      "It started off really suspenseful for me but as I kept reading I felt it was predicable and a little to far fetched.\n",
      "The ending was not the twist I thought--I wouldn't call it a twist, but rather predictable.\n",
      "I loved the first half of this book but I was very disappointed with the last quarter of it.\n",
      "I'm so glad I finished it even if the first 300 pages were painfully predictable and kind of boring.\n",
      "And I was afraid I'd get disappointed by the ending but she somehow left it open.\n",
      "I have a love/hate reaction to the ending.\n",
      "The end was sort of a letdown though.\n",
      "The ending was surprising which is usually not the case.\n",
      "I liked the ride, with all its highs and lows, and even if the ending is only logical, it's unsatisfying all the same.\n",
      "very suspenseful and believable story that kept me going until the very end.\n",
      "1st 3/4 of book was one of my favorite books, but the ending was horrible.\n",
      "Which was lucky as the ending is massively underwhelming.\n",
      "The ending is pretty unsatisfying after such an elaborate cat and mouse game but overall this was definitely compelling reading and worth a lot of the buzz it's getting.\n",
      "Couldn't give it 5 stars because I wanted a different ending.\n",
      "Really enjoyed this book until the end.\n",
      "Okay, here's the deal - I can't say I liked the characters in this book by the end, but I'm not sure I was supposed to.\n",
      "Also, the ending was not satisfying.\n",
      "Could not even finish it and I am a stickler for reading books till the very end.\n",
      "I would have expected a better ending from the same mind that came up with the rest of the book and all its details.\n",
      "I thought the actual ending was very clever but some of the steps on the way were hard to believe.\n",
      "I did not see any of the twists coming and it was just so fun to read!\n",
      "I found the ending slightly puzzling though - I'm not sure if it's a cop out or exactly right.\n",
      "I totally had lost interest by page 330, but read until the end anyway just to see how it would end.\n",
      "My only criticism would be the ending.\n",
      "I guess that's what thrillers are supposed to do, but I enjoyed the twists and plot surprises before it became anti-climactic.\n",
      "It made me feel completely dissatisfied, and even a little cheated, at the tone the book finished on.\n",
      "I loved that the style changed several times to fit the story, and that it ended without tying up the loose ends.\n",
      "At first I couldn't put the book down but towards the end of it it seemed to drag on.\n",
      "I really couldn't put it down and I read it late into the night because, unlike many other thrillers, it wasn't obvious which way it was going to go.\n",
      "I won't go into the details, but I really did like the story and have already recommended it to others.\n",
      "Well it was a fun thriller I only finished because I wanted to know how it ended.\n",
      "Gave it only four stars because the ending was too facile for my taste.\n",
      "As unsatisfying as the ending is, I think it's perfectly appropriate for the characters.\n",
      "The ending was also ridiculous, and like everything else seemed very thrown together at the last-minute.\n",
      "The more I think about the ending, the more I realize it ended right on the mark.\n",
      "The story didn't blow me away or anything but I did enjoy it!\n",
      "Could not put it down literally, finished reading it in one sitting because I badly wanted to know how it ended.\n",
      "The ending is less than satisfying (one-star reviewers online, by far, hate the ending).\n",
      "I found the end a little unsatisfying, though.\n",
      "I liked the twist & turns but it got wordy and kept losing my attention.\n",
      "The ending left me hanging and wanting more.\n",
      "The dialogue and the characters kept me interested, but the ending ruined the story for me.\n",
      "It loses a star for the \"tricks\" the author plays that made me feel like she was manipulating me, for the end that was probably a great ending for some but not fulfilling for me, and for occasional language that made me go, \"Really?\n",
      "If it wasn't for the ending, it would have been a straight five from me.\n",
      "I certainly did not predict the ending.\n",
      "I did like the twist but it was only slightly surprising.\n",
      "Captivating from start to finish- however i didn't love the main character.\n",
      "I really did not enjoy this book and to be honest, I couldn't even finish it.\n",
      "It was dark and disturbing at many points, but so well written I literally couldn't wait to finish.\n",
      "It read like a normal thriller to me but the very end is kind of interesting in an F-up way.\n",
      "I loved the first half of this book but I felt like the second half was over exaggerated and unsatisfying.\n",
      "It had so many twists and turns that made me say, \"I never saw that coming\" again and again.\n",
      "I couldn't put it down, especially after the twist halfway through.\n",
      "The second half of the book dragged a bit and i thought the story became a bit contrived.\n",
      "The book started off well, and I immediately decided that I liked it.\n",
      "The book held my attention the whole way through, and I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.\n",
      "5, as the ending is terrible.\n",
      "I loved this book right up until the end.\n",
      "The twist in the middle definitely kept me going, when i was almost putting the book down.\n",
      "it would have had 5 stars but i didn't love the ending.\n",
      "I wasn't sure in the beginning, but it really improved and I ended up liking the story.\n",
      "For all that I'd learnt from the characters - it didn't seem a likely ending.\n",

      "I suppose the only disappointment was the end, without giving this away it didn't really tie the ends up for me tight enough, there was unfinished business.\n",
      "What I didn't like or rather felt disappointed was the fact that I had expected a different ending.\n",

      "Not since watched the \"Usual Suspects\" have a Liked and disliked a book and an ending so much.\n",
      "This was so chilling and cleverly written, but I was spoiled for the ~twist before I finished reading it, so the entire experience was sort of ruined for me!\n",

      "I also do and can understand why the numerous people told me that they hated the ending.\n",

      "I'm also not thrilled with the end - it lagged on a bit and I'm not sure how I feel about the final conclusion.\n",
      "I still gave it 4 stars because it kept me completely entertained until that last chapter.\n",
      "i spent a good part of a day finishing up the last third of the book because i couldn't put it down.\n",

      "I didn't love the beginning but Im glad i hung in there because I ended up liking the book a lot.\n",

      "I kinda wish there was some justice in the end but when it finished it was like 'meh' - next please!\n",
      "I thought it was a really good thriller/mystery with some interesting twists and turns.\n",
      "There was a nice twist after that but I quickly figured out the end and that was a bummer.\n",
      "I found that very frustrating and by the end I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.\n",
      "But since I have read it, I think not finishing it would have been a mistake because it ended up being really insane.\n",
      "I few twists and turns I did not see coming, and I had to put it down a few times because I couln't stand the suspense.\n",

      "Definitely satisfying - even with such a disturbing ending.\n",
      "I would have given this more stars but the ending.\n",
      "In the end, I came away impressed by the cleverness that it took to write this, it just wasn't fun to read.\n",
      "The ending was a as it should be.\n",
      "Ultimately, the ending was appropriate, but perhaps a copout.\n",
      "Read this because of all the hype and I enjoyed it for a while and thought the \"twist\" was clever although not completely unexpected.\n",
      "The ending leaves a bit to be desired.\n",
      "But, still, I loved so much of this book, I would recommend it wholeheartedly, in spite of a so so ending.\n",
      "I've read the author's comments about the ending and can see her point that no other ending could have been plausible or satisfying without compromising the integrity of the characters, BUT STILL.\n",
      "I liked the twists and turns that the book took.\n",
      "While I liked the book, loved the plot twists, loved to despise the characters.\n",
      "Finally, I love the open ambiguity of the ending.\n",

      "With respect to the ending that people seem up in arms about, I wasn't bothered.\n",

      "I enjoyed it, I was surprised at plot twists.\n",
      "I also wanted to throw the book across the room after reading it because I was frustrated with the ending and with Nick.\n",
      "I was impressed not only with the writing but the various plot twists along the way and definitely didn't see the end of part one coming.\n",
      "I'll give it three stars even if I wished it ended differently and got kind of tired of the story about 2/3 of the way through.\n",
      "If you haven't read it, I won't spoil it, but there is no gray area with respect to the ending -- either you hate it or you love it.\n",
      "For some reason I totally didn't expect the ending, but on reflection I'm not sure how else it cold have ended, chilling.\n",
      "It took me a year to finish it because I wanted to forget the spoilers I heard (I didn't) but it was still fantastic, and completely nuts.\n",
      "It was still an engaging story and I couldn't stop reading.\n",
      "I'm not going to give it away and I have tried and tried to come up with a better ending.\n",
      "I enjoyed the twists and turns and enjoyed seeing the main characters unravel into entirely different people by the end of the story.\n",
      "I agree that there were some clever twists and turns and the writing was decent - but I never empathized with any of the characters.\n",
      "Lots of plot twists that kept me interested.\n",
      "But I still just don't enjoy mystery and the ending was freaky.\n",
      "Anyway, the book was pretty good with good twists and turns and in the end you realize that none of the characters are redeemable except maybe Go.\n",
      "I was disappointed in every way by the end.\n",
      "the plot was kind of predictable in parts, of found the writing to be poor at times and I just couldn't not enjoy this story at all.\n",
      "It was a good read, though I enjoyed the last part if the book far more than the first two.\n",
      "I only gave this 4 stars because I was disapointed with the ending.\n",
      "I was thinking on giving five stars but what was up with the ending?\n",
      "It was a slow start for me and I wasn't sure I was going to love it, but once I got past a certain point it was all ups and downs, twists and turns.\n",
      "A frustrating book that drove me nuts, but I had to see how it ended.\n",
      "Because of the number of comments from subscribers saying they didn't enjoy the second half of this book and despised the ending, I was quite nervous going into this.\n",
      "I almost stopped reading it entirely but I like to finish any book I start.\n",
      "Still, I don't like either of the protagonists, and the ending, while believable, didn't make my heart sing.\n",
      "I like that Nick in some ways got his redemption, but I've also honestly never been so upset with the ending of a novel.\n",
      "I started reading this book, not expecting it to end the way it did.\n",
      "Certain parts annoyed me, like the ending with Desi and the ending with Nick, but just because the plot annoyed doesn't mean it wasn't excellent.\n",
      "I mean there were some points where I thought the story would go in a different direction but then it didn't.\n",
      "I feel that it could have ended a good 60 or so pages before it actually did, and I found the ending to be poorly handled, unrealistic and unfulfilling, especially considering the brilliant job Flynn had done with the rest of the book.\n",
      "I went into the book expecting not to like it, so the beginning was quite slow for me.\n",
      "It will make a great film, but terrible ending for a book.\n",
      "I just don't know if I liked the second half of the book as much.\n",
      "I meant to give up on reading it early on but once half way I had to know the ending and I never cheat.\n",
      "While I couldn't put this book down because I was so eager to see what happened, I found the second half of the book really disappointing.\n",
      "I didn't really love it, but the plot was exciting, I guess.\n",
      "The ending really drives me nuts.\n",
      "What the hell was that ending?\n",
      "what the hell was that ending.\n",
      "I thought the story line was great, the characters were good (although I didn't really like either one by the end) and it had a lot of potiential!!\n",
      "And the ending, it just didn't sit right with me.\n",
      "But the second half had too many detours and details, and the ending was a huge disappointment.\n",
      "Well, they were right about the latter, but in my opinion very wrong to find the ending lacking in any way.\n",
      "I couldn't put it down and certainly couldn't see the twists that came.\n",
      "Before I read the book I saw a lot of reviews that said they really liked the book but not the ending.\n",
      "My only problem with it was the ending, which I'm not sure I'm in love with, but the writing is incredible.\n",
      "Considering the ending, I hope I remember not to reread that book.\n",
      "I loved the twists in the book, the begining is slightly slow but half way through it takes off and was hard to put down.\n",
      "I loved reading and trying to predict the ending, of which, I was totally wrong about.\n",
      "Have to say, was not expecting any of the major twist and was not expecting that ending!!\n",
      "The ending didn't thrill me but, lead to me wondering if a second book might be in the works.\n",
      "I liked the first three quarters of this one, but I really didn't care for the end.\n",
      "At first I was disappointed with the theme but I started giving it some thought and I'm not sure what ending I would have been happy with.\n",
      "The ending was creepy and that might be what won't leave me .\n",
      "A great story marred by a terrible ending.\n",
      "Two stars for an ending that made me want to throw the book across the room.\n",
      "In this one, I felt like the last third of the book kind of dragged and then - pow - the last two chapters were super short and the whole ending was tied up with very little resolution.\n",
      "I didn't like a single character, and the only thing that kept me reading was the feeling that my brain would probably implode if I didn't find out what happened.\n",
      "I have to say the ending was what I wanted although it's totally crazy as in mad.\n",
      "You have to suspend some disbelief for the ending on this one, but I find her reads highly gripping and suspenseful.\n",
      "The rest of it I kind of predicted, but it played out a bit differently and I was hooked again.\n",
      "The ending only deserves a 3.\n",
      "The ending totally undermines the first 90% of the book.\n",
      "Right from the very beginning this book completely sucked me in and the suspense kept me on edge.\n",
      "The rest of the book was so clever, I feel like there must have been a better way to end it.\n",
      "Still fun and well written, but I was waiting for a payoff that never came.\n",
      "It was certainly an original storyline which kept me guessing till the end.\n",
      "There were so many parts that I really enjoyed and I liked the surprising twists and turns in the book.\n",
      "I came back to change my rating because despite my initial disappointment with the ending, I found this book stayed with me.\n",
      "Even with the unsatisfying ending, I still would recommend this book and still rate it 5 stars.\n",
      "I recommend this novel highly and will be reading it over again, now that I know the ending!\n",
      "I loved it from start to finish.\n",
      "I understand that a lot of people thoroughly enjoyed this book and the writing really was quite compelling but I just could not find it in me to finish.\n",
      "And the ending was truly surprising.\n",
      "the story took too long to conclude like it just kept holding it off and instead of increasing the suspense (for me anyway) I struggled to not become bored.\n",
      "I actually had to read the last page twice cos I couldn't believe that this should be the end I was waiting for.\n"
