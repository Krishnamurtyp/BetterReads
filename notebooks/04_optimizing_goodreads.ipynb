    "# BetterReads: Optimizing GoodReads review data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how to achieve the best results with the BetterReads algorithm when using review data scraped from GoodReads. It is a short follow-up to the exploration performed in the `03_optimizing_reviews.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two options when scraping review data from GoodReads: For any given book, we can either scrape 1,500 reviews, with 300 reviews for each star rating (1 to 5), or we can scrape just the top 300 reviews, of any rating. (This is due to some quirks in the way that reviews are displayed on the GoodReads website; for more information, see my [GoodReadsReviewsScraper script](https://github.com/williecostello/GoodReadsReviewsScraper).)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages to both options. If we scrape 1,500 reviews, we obviously have more review data to work with; however, the data is artifically class-balanced, such that, for example, we'll still see a good number of negative reviews even if the vast majority of the book's reviews are positive. If we scrape just the top 300 reviews, we will have a more representative dataset, but much less data to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the `03_optimizing_reviews.ipynb` notebook that the BetterReads algorithm can achieve meaningful and representative results from a dataset with less than 100 reviews. So we should not dismiss the 300 review option simply because it involves less data. We should only dismiss it if its smaller dataset leads to worse results. So let's try these two options out on a particular book and see how the algorithm performs."

      "I even felt in the beginning that the book felt not very special, with the odd writing style and the slightly unlikeable characters.\n",
      "The author's writing is pretty good, I just didn't really like the characters and never really seemed to connect with them, which then makes me not as engaged with the plot line.\n",
      "It’s really interesting because some of her characters are unlikeable at times, but they feel realistic and they always develop as the story goes on and it’s really quite entertaining to read about.\n",
      "the characters aren’t particularly likeable, and the situation they are in isn’t particularly common, but it is interesting and I can tell it’s very well written.\n",
      "I liked the way it facilitated the story, but unlike in some other novels, the writing style isn't a notable part of the experience of Conversations with Friends.\n",
      "I really liked the ending and the way the protagonist was portrayed by the author (I saw a lot of myself in her, or rather I saw the worst side of myself) but at the same time I was frustrated with her character arc.\n",
      "I enjoy reading about self-centered, unlikeable characters but they have to be interesting which was not the case for me.\n",

      "Whereas Normal People spoke a bit more to the gravitational pull of a romantic relationship, Conversations With Friends captured the main character’s dysfunction and yearning to just be seen and valued by those around her.\n",
      "Her characters can be so swooningly affectionate with one another--and so ferociously cutting and so perfectly empathetic--that even at their most toxic moments (and there are lots), watching their relationships unfold feels like a privilege.\n",
      "She's insightful about the emotions involved in falling in love when one is both young and doing one's best to not admit to any sort of emotional entanglement.\n",
      "The way she writes relationships and conversations between the characters, making them normal and not artefact at all but at the same time not being trivial, it's exquisite.\n",
      "Altogether Conversations With Friends is an intelligent character study on falling in love, cultivating a relationship, and all of the simplicities and complexities that come with it.\n",
      "The plot offers nothing new either, there's been plenty of books on naive young adults pursuing unhealthy relationships before, as well as characters who make drama out of nothing and try to drag others in to their narcissism.\n",
      "It’s a beautiful and subtle novel with emotionally charged characters and nuances that felt so natural, mirroring the everyday aspects and constants in somebody’s lives: as simple as having a conversation with a friend.\n",
      "Sally Rooney’s novel, Conversations With Friends, reveals the complexities of relationships in the onset of love, platonically and otherwise, with a direct honesty and realism that made it difficult not to relate to.\n",

The only major difference is that the bigger dataset includes a cluster of sentences expressing dislike of the book, whereas the smaller dataset includes a cluster of sentences expressing love of the book. But this was to be expected, given the relative proportions of positive and negative reviews between the two datasets.\n",
