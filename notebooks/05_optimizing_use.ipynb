    "# BetterReads: Optimizing the Universal Sentence Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a short investigation into which version of the Universal Sentence Encoder should be used for the BetterReads algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of the Universal Sentence Encoder currently made available through TensorFlow Hub: [`universal-sentence-encoder`](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) and [`universal-sentence-encoder-large`](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5). These two encoders are also referred to as Encoders 4 and 5, respectively. Curiously, `universal-sentence-encoder-large` seems to be about half the size of `universal-sentence-coder`, and Encoder 4, not 5, seems to be TensorFlow's recommended version.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using Encoder 4 thus far, as it's the default option in TensorFlow Hub. But it's possible that Encoder 5 will perform better than Encoder 4, either in terms of our model's output or in terms of our model's performance time. Let's see what, if any, differences we can observe."
